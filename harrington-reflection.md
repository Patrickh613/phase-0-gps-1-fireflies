What Git concepts were your struggling with prior to the GPS session? For me, the hardest concept concerning Git is maneuvering the directories and keeping track of where you are and which files go where. Also, the cloning and pushing of repos and commits.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS? The concept of cloning and pushing repos and commits was clarified pretty well for me, as well as the idea that you add/commit files and push branches.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? I talked to my pair about the process of cloning repos from GitHub to the local bash, and asked my guide about the process of fetching.
What still confuses you about Git? The process of navigating working directories still confuses. I'm so familiar with the concept of navigating directorie visually thorugh the GUI that I have a hard time keeping track of which branch I'm on and the current path of where I'm at, and I still haven't quite memorized the Git commands for that.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? Overall, my first experience was very pleasant. I think it help my pair and I out a lot to have a guide in place who was able to help us stay on track a nod approval of the decisions my pair and I had to clue us that we were on the right track.
