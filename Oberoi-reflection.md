# ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS IN YOUR REFLECTION

  1.  Prior to the GPS session, I was struggling with the adding and committing
      a git file. With repetition during the GPS session, I am no longer 
      struggling.
  2.  During the GPS, Gary, the Guide, really helped clear up the confusions 
      we had regarding push and pull requests. In addition, the fetch command
      and the merge command was also cleared up.
  3.  I asked about the importance of clarity and tense (past or present), when
      adding a commit message. I wanted to know the significance of "Added commit
      message" versus "Add commit message".
  4.  I think I have a good handle on git. Occassionally, I will get confused 
      when trying to merge branches locally. In addition, when fetching from 
      Github and merging, I still get a likke confused.
  5.  Pairing in the GPS was great! Patrick and Gary were very nice and helpful.
      So far, I've done all my assignments by myself. So it was nice to know and
      get the reassurance that I am going down the right track, and my work
      and my thought-process are accurate.
